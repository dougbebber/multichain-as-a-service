# 1. Introduction
The Multichain-as-a-Service project is intended to deliver an environment that accelerates learning and prototyping with Multichain -> private, permissioned blockchains. It provides the ability to create and deploy a new blockchain,and a Multichain Explorer for the newly deployed blockchain in the cloud. New blockchains are created and deployed by sending a "createToken" to the Service. The name of the new blockchain is passed as metadata on the createToken blockchain transaction.
