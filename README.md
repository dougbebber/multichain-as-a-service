# 1. Introduction
The Multichain-as-a-Service project is intended to deliver an environment that accelerates learning and prototyping with Multichain -> private, permissioned blockchains. It provides the ability to create and deploy new blockchains,along with Multichain Explorers for the newly deployed blockchains in the cloud. 

New blockchains are created and deployed by sending a "createToken" to a specific Service address. The name of the new blockchain is passed as metadata on the createToken blockchain transaction.
