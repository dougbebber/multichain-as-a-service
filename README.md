It provides the ability to create and deploy new blockchains,along with Multichain Explorers for the newly deployed blockchains in the cloud. 

New blockchains are created and deployed by sending a "createToken" to a specific Service address. The name of the new blockchain is passed as metadata on the createToken blockchain transaction.
